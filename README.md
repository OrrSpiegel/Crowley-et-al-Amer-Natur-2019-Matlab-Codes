# Crowley-et-al-Amer-Natur-2019-Matlab-Codes
# This repository includes codes used for the model in the manuscript (now accepted). 
# Written by Phil Crowley and Pete Trimmer. 
# Included are the two computer programs ThresherLL and ThresherPP and the two functions BetaVec and FDraw used to produce the figures.
# Specifically, ThresherLL, BetaVec, and FDraw produced Figure 3, and ThresherPP and BetaVec produced Figures 4-6, B-1, and C-1.
# To create the different figures and panels, parameter magnitudes are changed in the early lines of code and (for ThresherPP) further down in the block that establishes the parameters being varied to create the x-axes. 
# Note that in this block, all but the relevant limits and parameter variation are removed during an individual run. 
# In the Output block at the end of the programs, all but the relevant axes and plots are also removed.
# The code is thoroughly commented. Please cite this reference when using the code or sections from within.
